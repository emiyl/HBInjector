# HBInjector

Replaces System Apps with VitaShell. This stops them being lost when formatting. This is useful for HENkaku Enso on 3.65, as it is difficult to regain access to VitaShell again after a format.

## Please don't use this

This is obselete now because there's a browser exploit on 3.65. Don't even use the code to learn from, it's actual garbage.
